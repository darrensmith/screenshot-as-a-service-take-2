# Screenshot as a Service

A simple screenshot web service powered by [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/). Initially forked from [screenshot-app](http://github.com/visionmedia/screenshot-app).

This application has been forked and revised so as to eliminate sync and async modes and serve a default image when one does not exist in the cache. The fileCleaner service has also been replaced with the refreshService which after every refreshPeriod will asynchronously refresh the screenshot. Lifetime config parameter now defines the number of refresh cycles of inactivity before the file is deleted. Every time the file is actively requested the refresh counter is reset to 1.

## Setup

First [install](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) phantomjs, then clone this repo and install the deps:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the app:

```
$ node app
Express server listening on port 3000
```

## Usage

For a quick test with the command line, type:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/?url=www.google.com > google.png
```

Here is the complete usage documentation, also accessible on `/usage.html`:

```

# 1 second after it's loaded

# Use an HTML form to ask for a screenshot
GET /form.html
```

Screenshots are cached for one minute, so that frequent requests for the same screenshot don't slow the service down. You can adjust or disable caching in the project configuration (see below).

## Configuration

Create a `config/development.yaml` or a `config/production.yaml` to override any of the settings found in the `config/default.yaml`:

```yml
rasterizer:
  command: phantomjs   # phantomjs executable
  port: 3001           # internal service port. No need to allow inbound or outbound access to this port
  path: '/tmp/'        # where the screenshot files are stored
  viewport: '1024x600' # browser window size. Height grows according to the content
cache:
  refreshPeriod: 10000 # 10 seconds before screenshot image is refreshed in cache
  lifetime: 6          # 6 refresh cycles of inactivity befor screenshot image is deleted
server:
  port: 3000           # main service port
```
